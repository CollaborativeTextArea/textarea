# Collaborative Textarea
### https://textarea.js.org or https://collaborativetextarea.github.io/Temptextarea/

Collaborative Textarea is an website that runs 24/7, `(no backend 😂)`  
this tool can allow you to write essays or code with your friends, or anybody globally over the internet using the peer ID that you can share.  
Don't worry, it's near 0% that somebody will brute-force and get your peer ID `(if it's not near 0%, that's ChatGPT's calculation fault 👍)`

> Ok, enough writing, you get the point now.
>
> Yo, if you're having difficulty coding, just turn on night mode in your browser!!
>
> Or, if anything else, well, idk, do an issue I guess?

*`(yes the page looks like bareminimum but when you click the x button in the popup everything just looks right as it should be except for coding in light mode anyways lol)`*
