# ⚠️ PRIVACY ⚠️
## ⚠️ IMPORTANCE REGARDING ABOUT YOUR SAFETY ⚠️
If you have been using the collaborative textarea tool (temptextarea) there's a massive security risk, since this tool relies on peer2peer which is good for local based use and neighbors, `(well but if your internet sucks and there internet sucks, well and you live in the other side of earth then this tool is very slow)`
however on the main topic

## What can be leaked
- IP address *`(trigger word)`*
- ISP info that is publicly available when you search
- and your public ip and could get ddosed or hacked in worse case scenario if you have vuln ports
## What can be done to prevent this
- use a proxy server or VPN

# ⚠️ WHY ⚠️
too lazy, and too broke to afford a server, same goes for buying and literally buying.

actually VPN is free too so why getting mad?

oh wait is it because its slow?

too bad i cant do anything about it im too broke to even fix anything and give a proper update to fix this issues
and i will probably be flagged as a spammer if i use an API from someone for a server in middle to protect your ISP `(public)` data getting leaked
